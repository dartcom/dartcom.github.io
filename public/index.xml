      <description>Continuing on the first post, we are going to tackle the first part of this project, the displays.&#xA;The display As mentioned before, I settled for the VS035ZSM panel by BOE. While there are panels out there that fit better to what I want to achieve, this will do for now. Its specs are:&#xA;resolution: 1440 * 1600 size: 3.5&#39; input: Dual MIPI DSI framerate: 90 fps color depth: 8-bit driver ic: NT57860 Getting the datasheets Unfortunately, both, display datasheet and MIPI protocol datasheets require an NDA.</description>

      <description>Ever since I started flying FPV drones back in 2018 the one thing that bothered me, was how our FPV goggles were the only thing that the FPV community treated as a black box. We buy a pair of them, we do our thing and that&amp;rsquo;s it! Maybe a DVR mod or power switch mod here and there and not much more!&#xA;In 2021 during the lockdown I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything better to do, so I started investigating what makes these goggles tick and how could I design a pair.</description>

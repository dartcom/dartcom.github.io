				<p>Ever since I started flying FPV drones back in 2018 the one thing that bothered me, was how our FPV goggles were the only thing that the FPV community treated as a black box. We buy a pair of them, we do our thing and thats it! Maybe a DVR mod or power switch mod here and there and not much more!</p>
<p>In 2021 during the lockdown I didn&rsquo;t have anything better to do, so I started investigating what makes these goggles tick and how could I design a pair. After looking at many teardowns of both FPV and VR headsets I found that the entire headset design revolves around the displays. For FPV headsets there existed three categories</p>
<ul>
<li>slim goggles containing microdisplays and pancake optics. While these are the most attractive option, they also cost the most, with the bulk of it being the microdisplays.</li>
<li>bulky goggles that are cheap. Usually they come with a 4-5 inch display and a fresnell</li>
</ul>
<p>When looking at FPV goggle teardowns the main component were the displays and the optics</p>

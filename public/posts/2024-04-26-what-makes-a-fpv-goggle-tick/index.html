				<p>Ever since I started flying FPV drones back in 2018 the one thing that bothered me, was how our FPV goggles were the only thing that the FPV community treated as a black box. We buy a pair of them, we do our thing and thats it! Maybe a DVR mod or power switch mod here and there and not much more!</p>
<p>In 2021 during the lockdown I didn&rsquo;t have anything better to do, so I started investigating what makes these goggles tick and how could I design a pair. After looking at many teardowns of both FPV and VR headsets I found that the entire headset design revolves around the displays. For FPV headsets there exist two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>slim goggles containing two microdisplays and pancake optics. While these are the most light-weight option, they have a high cost, with the bulk of it being the microdisplays. A well designed headset of this category is the Orqa v1/v2 by Orqa FPV.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>box goggles. Usually they come with a single 4-5 inch display and a fresnel lens. They are big and cumbersome, but they are also cheap and can acommodate pilots with bad eyesight by having the space for glasses. A well designed headset of this category, is the eachine/skyzone cobra goggles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually I kinda lied, some headsets belong in neither of those categories. Headsets like the DJI FPV goggles v1/v2, Topsky prime 1s/2s, SJ RG01 contain two small displays and simpler fresnel lenses. They combine a relatively smaller frame with the big FOV that box goggles offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The DJI goggles are typically well received. They use two 2.5&rsquo; displays and they crop them in order to simulate a 1&rsquo; display, in order to bring the FOV to a managable level. Their main disadvantage is that they work well only with the first gen DJI FPV system. They lack HDMI inputs and</li>
<li>The same cannot be said about the topsky and SJ headsets. They both lack the same thing, high resolution displays, and this is the reason why they both didn&rsquo;t succeed commercially.</li>
</ul>
<p>What if I could combine these 3 headsets?</p>
<p>What if I could make a headset with high resolution cropped displays like the DJI v1, while having the form factor of the Topsky prime?</p>
<p>After some digging in Aliexpress I found some cheap VR display kits. These contain 2 displays, a gerneric driver board and a specialized board to bridge the displays to the driver board. These kits are not what I want. My requirements for the electronics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>analog video input</li>
<li>hdmi video input</li>
<li>the ability to scale down the display, to simulate a smaller one</li>
<li>OSD and menu support</li>
</ul>
<p>So far I have not found any kits that come close to implement these requirements. This means that I will have to design my own video processing system and display driver.</p>
